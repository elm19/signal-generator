All API requests are made to Base URL:

```

```

## How the API Works

Our platform is built around a Flask-based REST API, designed for **daily signal-based trading** â€” not high-frequency or real-time trading. The API serves precomputed predictions and model data that update once per day.

## Daily Update Cycle

At the end of each trading day (around **10:00 PM UTC**), a scheduled task runs on the server. This task:

* Gathers the most recent market data
* Uses each model to generate the **next day's prediction**
* Saves the results to a database

Once this process is complete, the platform is ready to serve the same predictions consistently throughout the next business day via the API.

## Stored Predictions

All prediction-related endpoints return data from the most recent run. This allows for:

* Fast and consistent API responses
* Reliable behavior during the business day (no live model inference)
* Simplified integration for automated or manual trading systems

## Weekend Retraining

On weekends, the platform optionally updates selected models using newly available weekly data. This includes:

* Fine-tuning high-performing models
* Adding new user-submitted models
* Re-running backtests to refresh performance metrics

This retraining pipeline improves accuracy and keeps model performance up to date without affecting weekday stability.
