### 2. **Experimental Models Repository**

* This is where our **initial prototypes** and **experimental model iterations** were developed.
* It contains rough drafts, early ideas, and test notebooks.

## Running Locally

To run any of the components locally:

1. **Fork** the repository you want to work with.
2. **Clone** your forked version.
3. Follow the **README.md** provided in each repository for local setup instructions.

Each README includes details like:

* Required dependencies
* Environment configuration
* How to start the server or application

Make sure to create virtual environments when needed and install packages using the correct requirements file.

If you're contributing to more than one part (e.g., frontend + backend), consider running each in its own terminal or workspace.
