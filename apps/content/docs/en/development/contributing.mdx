Weâ€™re always looking for passionate individuals to help grow and improve this project. Whether you're a developer, trader, researcher, or enthusiastâ€”there are multiple ways you can contribute and make a meaningful impact.

## ðŸ“˜ General Contributions

Here are some of the most common ways to contribute:

* **Improve the documentation**: Fix typos, clarify explanations, or add missing sections.
* **Translate the documentation**: Help us reach a broader audience by translating our docs into different languages.
* **Suggest improvements**: Found a bug? Have a better way to structure something? Let us know by opening an issue.

## ðŸ§ª Model Testing (Demo Trading)

One practical and very valuable way to contribute is by testing our models in a **demo trading** environment. By simulating trades based on the modelâ€™s daily signals, you help us:

* Understand real-world performance
* Identify strengths and weaknesses
* Collect more robust metrics

> ðŸ“Œ See our [Backtest](../core-concepts/backtest.md) section to learn about backtesting, then move to [Demo Trading Guide](../configuration/contribution.md) for step-by-step setup.

If you test one of our models, weâ€™d love to hear from you! Share the results with us (metrics, notes, screenshots)â€”this feedback is crucial.

## ðŸš€ Create and Share Your Own Models

Want to design your own models and contribute them to the project? Great! Hereâ€™s how:

1. **Fork this repository**.
2. Inside the `/models` folder, **create a folder with your GitHub username**.
3. In your folder, create subfolders for each model (e.g. `model1`, `model2`, etc.).
4. Each model folder should contain:

   * `predict.py`: A script that shows how to load and use your model to predict signals.
   * `train.py` or a training notebook: Shows how your model is trained.
   * `README.md`: A detailed explanation of your model, including:

     * What data it uses
     * What indicators/architectures are involved
     * Training procedure
     * Example results or backtest summary

Weâ€™ll review high-performing models and potentially add them to our main set.

If your model shows strong performance on unseen data and meets our evaluation criteria, it could become part of our production pipeline.

Weâ€™re excited to build this ecosystem together with the community. Thank you for being a part of it!
