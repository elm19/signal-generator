description: Leveraging Prediction Probabilities.
---

So far, we've discussed how a model can output a signal for each trading day: **buy**, **sell**, or **hold**. This approach is simple and practical—but it doesn't tell the whole story.

Many models, particularly those trained for classification, can also return **probabilities** for each class. Instead of simply saying "buy," a model might predict:

* `buy`: 72% probability
* `hold`: 20%
* `sell`: 8%

These probabilities offer deeper insight into the model's confidence, which can be used to build **more advanced and nuanced strategies**.

## Why Use Probabilities?

Simple signals treat all predictions as equal. But not all predictions are made with the same level of certainty. A model that outputs `buy` with 51% confidence is not the same as one with 90% confidence.

Using probabilities allows you to:

* **Avoid low-confidence trades** by setting a threshold (e.g. only act if confidence > 65%)
* **Size positions dynamically** based on confidence levels
* **Combine multiple models** using ensemble logic, where each model's vote is weighted by its confidence
* **Detect indecision**: If probabilities are balanced, the model is likely uncertain—a good time to avoid trading

## Example Strategy Using Probabilities

Here's a conceptual example of how probabilities can guide trading decisions:

* If `buy` probability > 70% → enter long
* If `sell` probability > 70% → enter short
* If no class exceeds 70% → hold
* If currently in a trade and the opposing signal exceeds 70% → exit and reverse

This strategy avoids acting on weak or ambiguous predictions, reducing unnecessary trades.

## Where This Fits In the Pipeline

To recap:

1. **Market data** is collected
2. **Targets** (buy/sell/hold) are created
3. **Indicators** are added
4. **Sequencing** and **splitting** are done
5. **Model** is trained
6. **Evaluation** is performed (ML metrics and backtesting)
7. **Predictions** are generated
8. **Strategies** are applied

What we describe here happens **after Step 7**, when the model produces raw predictions. This page expands your toolbox for building intelligent strategies on top of those predictions.

## Summary

Using prediction probabilities can:

* Improve trade quality
* Allow adaptive risk control
* Help reduce noise from uncertain signals

We encourage experimenting with these ideas to develop your own trading logic. They can significantly enhance both the **robustness** and **performance** of your final strategy.
