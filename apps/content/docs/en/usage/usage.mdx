The Gold Futures Signal Trading Generator is designed to be accessible through multiple avenues, catering to different user needs.

## Via the Deployed API (Current Method)

The primary and currently available method to interact with the Gold Futures Signal Trading Generator is through its deployed Flask REST API. This API allows programmatic access to:

- Real-time trading signals: Get the latest "buy," "sell," or "hold" recommendations for gold futures.
- Model information: Retrieve details about the underlying machine learning models and their performance metrics.

This method is ideal for:

- Developers: Integrating signals directly into custom trading applications, algorithms, or bots.
- Analysts: Fetching data for further analysis or incorporation into dashboards.

To learn how to interact with the API, proceed to [API Usage (Current Deployment)](/docs/api/api-documentation).

## Through the Future User Interface (Planned)

In a future development phase, a dedicated user interface (UI) will be implemented. This interface will provide a more intuitive and visual way to consume the trading signals and monitor model performance.

The planned UI will feature:

- A dashboard displaying current signals and confidence levels.
- Historical signal performance charts.
- Insights into individual model metrics and backtest results.
- Potentially, configuration options for users.

This method will be ideal for:

- Traders: Who prefer a visual overview and direct interaction without coding.
- Non-technical users: Who need actionable signals at a glance.

Details on this future integration can be found in the [Future Integration Roadmap](/docs/development/roadmap).

## Local Development & Customization

For those interested in the technical internals, extending functionality, or simply running the project in a local environment, the generator's codebase is available for local setup and customization.

This method is ideal for:

- Developers: Modifying models, adding new features, or experimenting with different data sources.
- Learners: Those who want to dive deep and understand how the model was created.
