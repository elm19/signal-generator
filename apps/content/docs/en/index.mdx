description: High-level explanation of the Gold Futures Signal Trading Generator
---

The Gold Futures Signal Trading Generator is a robust system designed to generate predictive trading signals (e.g., "buy," "sell," "hold") for gold futures contracts. Its core objective is to automate and enhance trading decisions through a systematic, data-driven approach. The project is built around a Flask-based REST API, which serves as the primary interface for accessing these predictions. Underpinning the API is a sophisticated data pipeline that collects, preprocesses, and engineers features from historical gold futures data, which then feeds into recurrent neural networks (RNNs) like LSTMs and GRUs. Each model undergoes rigorous backtesting to ensure its viability and provide comprehensive performance metrics.

## Target Audience

This documentation is tailored for various users: developers interested in API integration, traders looking for signal insights, and anyone curious about the technical aspects of the generator.
