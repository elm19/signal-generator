description: Learn the different ways to interact with the Multi-Market AI Signal Trading Platform

The platform is designed to be accessible through two main methods, each suited to different user needs and technical backgrounds.

## 1. Web Interface (Recommended for Most Users)

The simplest way to explore predictions and model data is through our interactive [dashboard](/dashboard).

Users can:

* Select a market (e.g., Gold Futures, NASDAQ, etc.)
* Choose a model from the list available for that market
* View signal predictions (Buy / Hold / Sell), model performance metrics, and historical trades visually on an interactive chart

This method is ideal for:

* Traders and analysts who prefer visual signal exploration
* Non-technical users interested in model insights

No coding or setup is requiredâ€”just visit the website and start exploring.

## 2. REST API (For Programmatic Access)

The platform also exposes a Flask-based REST API that allows developers and technical users to programmatically retrieve data.

The API provides access to:

* **Predictions**: Signal probabilities and decisions for each model and market
* **Model Info**: Metadata like training loss, backtest return, and confidence levels
* **Backtesting Results**: Historical trades and performance evaluation metrics

This method is ideal for:

* Developers building automated trading systems
* Data scientists incorporating signals into custom analysis pipelines

To learn how to interact with the API in detail, see the [API Reference](/docs/api/overview).
