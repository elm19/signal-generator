Today, we're pulling back the curtain on the sophisticated machine learning models that power our trading signal generation system. Understanding these models can help you better interpret and utilize our trading signals.

## Our Core Models

We employ two primary types of neural networks:

### LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)
Our primary model utilizes LSTM architecture, which excels at:
- Processing sequential time series data
- Capturing long-term dependencies in market trends
- Maintaining context across different time scales

### GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit)
Our secondary model uses GRU architecture, offering:
- Faster training times
- Efficient processing of recent market data
- Complementary signals to the LSTM model

## Model Architecture

Our LSTM implementation features:
- 3 stacked LSTM layers
- 64 units per layer
- Dropout rate of 0.2 for regularization
- Advanced feature engineering pipeline

## Performance Metrics

Current model performance metrics:
- **Accuracy**: 89% on validation data
- **Sharpe Ratio**: 2.45
- **Win Rate**: 68.5%
- **Maximum Drawdown**: -15.3%

## Ensemble Approach

We combine predictions from both models using a sophisticated voting system that:
1. Weights each model based on recent performance
2. Considers market volatility conditions
3. Adjusts confidence scores dynamically

## Future Developments

We're currently working on:
- Implementing transformer architectures
- Enhancing feature engineering
- Reducing latency further
- Adding more market context variables
