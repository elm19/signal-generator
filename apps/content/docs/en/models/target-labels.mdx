title: Target Labels
description: How to define and generate target labels for supervised trading models, focusing on detecting sharp price moves using ATR-based thresholds.
---

Creating effective labels is a key part of building any supervised trading model. There are many possible approaches to defining these labels, and your choice should reflect **how you plan to use the model's outputs**.

In our case, we aim to detect **sharp increases or decreases** in price—moments that suggest a strong trading opportunity. Below, we explain the logic we used to label our dataset.

## Labeling Logic

For each trading day in our dataset:

* We look ahead to the **next 7 days**.
* If there's a **sharp decrease** in price during that window, we label the current day as `1` (**Buy**).
* If there's a **sharp increase**, we label it as `-1` (**Sell**).
* If neither condition is met, we label it as `0` (**Hold**).

This way, the model learns to anticipate sharp moves ahead of time—whether upward or downward.

## What Defines a Sharp Move?

To define what qualifies as "sharp," we use the **Average True Range (ATR)**. A price movement is considered sharp if:

> The percentage change between today's close and any of the next 7 closes exceeds **1.5 × ATR**.

## Why ATR?

ATR captures the market's recent volatility. Using a fixed percentage would not adapt to different market conditions. ATR allows us to set a threshold that's responsive to the current level of price movement.

This makes the labeling process more **robust and dynamic**, especially across different assets or time periods.

## Visual Example

Below is a chart showing how these target labels align with price movements:

![Close Price with Targets](/images/g1.png)

* Green triangles (▲) represent **Buy** signals (`1`)
* Red triangles (▼) represent **Sell** signals (`-1`)
* Days without markers are **Hold** (`0`)

You can see how the labels correspond to local peaks and dips in the price action.

### What Comes Next?

Once the data is labeled, the next step is preparing the features that help the model **predict those labels**. This includes adding indicators, generating input sequences, and training the model.
